Subject: [PATCH 326/437] media: i2c: adv748x: Add missing CBUS page
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The ADV748x has 12 pages mapped onto I2C addresses.

In the existing implementation only 11 are mapped correctly in the page
enumerations, which causes an off-by-one fault on pages above the
infoframe definition due to a missing 'CBUS' page.

This causes the address for the CEC, SDP, TXA, and TXB to be incorrectly
programmed during the iterations in adv748x_initialise_clients().

Until now this has gone un-noticed due to the fact that following the
creation of the clients - the device is reset and the addresses are
reprogrammed in manually by the call to "adv748x_write_regs(state,
adv748x_set_slave_address);"

As part of moving to dynamic i2c address allocations repair this by
providing the missing CBUS page definition.
