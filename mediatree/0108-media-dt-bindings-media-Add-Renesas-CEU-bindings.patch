+Renesas Capture Engine Unit (CEU)
+----------------------------------------------
+
+The Capture Engine Unit is the image capture interface found in the Renesas
+SH Mobile and RZ SoCs.
+
+The interface supports a single parallel input with data bus width of 8 or 16
+bits.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Shall be "renesas,r7s72100-ceu" for CEU units found in RZ/A1H
+  and RZ/A1M SoCs.
+- reg: Registers address base and size.
+- interrupts: The interrupt specifier.
+
+The CEU supports a single parallel input and should contain a single 'port'
+subnode with a single 'endpoint'. Connection to input devices are modeled
+according to the video interfaces OF bindings specified in:
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt
+
+Optional endpoint properties applicable to parallel input bus described in
+the above mentioned "video-interfaces.txt" file are supported.
+
+- hsync-active: Active state of the HSYNC signal, 0/1 for LOW/HIGH respectively.
+  If property is not present, default is active high.
+- vsync-active: Active state of the VSYNC signal, 0/1 for LOW/HIGH respectively.
+  If property is not present, default is active high.
+
+Example:
+
+The example describes the connection between the Capture Engine Unit and an
+OV7670 image sensor connected to i2c1 interface.
